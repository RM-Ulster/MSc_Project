# MSc_Project
Scripts for GEE and python that I used in my MSc project. GEE for data collection, pre-processing, and extraction. Python for training and applying the RF model

This is the order that they were used:

1. [Topo_Data_Prep](https://code.earthengine.google.com/7acdb906d98cd9a32054a4e1df61091e) - Script to prepare a raster of topographic data and export it to an EE asset.

2. [S2_Image_Prep](https://code.earthengine.google.com/da483f153e9d8206e61505aad8569537) - Script to prepare a raster of S2 data and export it to an EE asset.

3. [S1_Image_Prep]
