Scripts for GEE and python that I used in my MSc project. GEE for data collection, pre-processing, and extraction. Python for training and applying the RF model

This is the order that they were used:

1. [Topo_Data_Prep](https://code.earthengine.google.com/85e0ef618b52c9d69e381b725532a5ac) - Script to prepare a raster of topographic data and export it to an EE asset.
